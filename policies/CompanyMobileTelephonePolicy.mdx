If any abuse or misuse of a company mobile phone is identified, it must be reported to a line manager or the operations team immediately. 

As employees of the company may work remotely meaning that their phones are a primary source of communications, users must regularly check their device for incoming messages from text, voicemail, email, Wildix, LinkedIn, Microsoft Teams’ messages and WhatsApp. This list is not exhaustive and may change from time to time with advances in technology. v.

Company mobile phones must not be used to call any premium rate number. If an employee calls a premium rate number without management authorisation in advance, then the employee will be personally liable to pay any additional charges incurred. The deduction will be taken from the employee’s salary within an agreed repayment plan. 

## **Breaches of the policy **

Employees who do not follow the terms of this policy will be liable to disciplinary action and, depending on the nature of the breach, may also be liable to legal proceedings. 

## **Personal use **

## The company mobile phone is supplied to employees to carry out all business activity. A company mobile phone must not be used for personal use unless authorised to do so by a Group Director. 

Under no circumstances must any company business or information be carried out or saved on an employee’s personal mobile device. This includes via text, voicemail, email, LinkedIn, Microsoft Teams’ messages and WhatsApp etc (this list is not exhaustive). 

## **Preferred Supplier **

The choice of supplier will be determined by the board and the operations team. 

## **Coverage **

No mobile phone can provide coverage all the time. Voicemail is available for incoming calls in 

situations where there is no coverage. 

## **Voicemail **

Users should ensure that their voicemail is set up. 

## **Passwords and Passcodes **

The user must create a lock-screen passcode when they are given the device. This must be given to the user’s line manager when they hand the device back/ leave the company.

Mobile phone users should not download software onto their phones unless authorised to do so 

by the operations team. Downloads may contain viruses which can render the phone useless and  irreparable.

The deduction will be taken from the employee’s salary within an agreed repayment plan. 

In addition, employees should not delete any programme that exists on the phone at the time of issue. 

## **Lost, Stolen or Damaged Mobile Phones and Accessories **

The safeguarding of the company mobile phone is the employee’s responsibility. If an employee’s mobile phone is lost or stolen, this should be reported immediately to the employee’s line manager and the admin team. Due to the mobile phone having access to company email accounts, LinkedIn etc, loss or theft of a company mobile phone is classed as a Data Breach and a Data Breach Report Form must be filled in by the employee’s line manager. (See Data Breach Policy). 

In the event that a company mobile phone is lost, stolen or damaged. The employee will be expected to cover the cost for the company to replace or fix the handset. The deduction will be taken from the employee’s salary within an agreed repayment plan. 

All company mobile phones are covered by insurance for theft and accidental damage, but will still be required by the provider to pay a small feel to cover some costs. Loss of devices is not covered by our provider. In the event of a lost mobile phone, the employee will be responsible for the full cost of the device. 

If an employee removes the company’s asset sticker tag from the device, the employee will be expected to pay a fee of £60 to replace the sticker tag. The cost will be taken from the employee’s salary within an agreed repayment plan. 

Upon issuing of a mobile phone to a user, they will also be provided with an Apple Lightning charging cable. If this is lost and needs to be replaced, a fee of £20 will be taken from the employee’s salary within an agreed repayment plan. 

## **Redundant or Surplus Mobile Phone **

If a mobile phone is replaced or upgraded due to age, or where a mobile phone becomes surplus, it should be returned to the operations team. Finally, it should be noted that the company reserves the right to request immediate return of any device on demand. 

**Leaving the Company**\
All employees must ensure that they return their mobile telephone and charging cable on or before their last day. If not returned, the cost of the handset and cable would be taken from the employee’s final salary.
