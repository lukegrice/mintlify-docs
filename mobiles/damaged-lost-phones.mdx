### Insurance

All devices are covered by Hardsoft Computers Ltd under our Safeguard Policy. Devices are covered for Theft and Accidential Damage **but not loss.**

You can only claim twice for a device within the lease term. Should your device be stolen or damaged more than twice within a lease, you will be liable to pay the full cost of replacement (see below).

### Additional Insurance and AppleCare

The employee can take out additional insurance (such as AppleCare, or insurance that covers loss) should they wish. Should the employee loose their device, they must still notify us as per the Company Mobile Phone Policy. The organization is not liable for paying any excess or handling claims on insurance policies employees have taken out themselves.

### Cracked Screen

<Info>
  Always peel off the screen protector and check the screen is damaged before making a claim.

If the screen is damaged please submit a support ticket. There is a **£49 insurance excess** that you are personally liable for. This will be taken from your salary once the claim is processed.

Just the protector that's cracked? Request a new screen protector via a support ticket.

### Other Damage & Faults

### Lost Phones

If the phone is not where you left it, it's likely been stolen. Please go online and get a **crime reference number**. If this is not completed within 48 hours of the phone going missing, you will be liable for the full replacement cost as outlined above.

<Warning>
  There is a limit of 2 insurance claims per person per lease agreement.
