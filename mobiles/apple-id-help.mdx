### Managed Apple IDs

Most Apple IDs within the business are Managed Apple IDs. This means that the company manages the Apple ID on your behalf. Some members of staff may have Apple IDs with a company email that they have created themsleves.

### Reset Apple ID Password

Everyone should be able to reset their Apple ID password themselves via Apple's self service portal. If you have a Managed Apple ID and need help with resetting a password, we can assist via a support ticket.

<Warning>
  If you have created the Apple ID yourself, we are unable to assist with resetting the password as the Apple ID is not property of the business.
</Warning>

### iCloud and Backup

Managed Apple IDs (Apple IDs created by your organisation) have 5GB iCloud Storage and backups should happen automatically. Sometimes, messages do not automatically back up. You can turn this on manually within iCloud settings.
