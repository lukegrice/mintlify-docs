From time to time, call quality and connection can be poor. Here's a list of things you can try to improve call quality on your device.

### Reboot your Device

Rebooting the device sounds basic, but this forces a network refresh that may resolve your issue immediately. 

### Headsets, AirPods & Headphones

These can cause all sorts of issues with the connection. Try and make a call without the device connected and see if it makes a difference to the call quality. If it does, over a number of calls, the issue is most likely the perphirial you are using.

### WiFi Calling

WiFi calling can either improve call quality or significantly degrade it, try and enable/disable WiFi calling and see if it makes a difference to the quality of the call. Find a guide below on how to enable/disable WiFi calling.

<Info>
  We have prioritised traffic for WiFi calling on our internet networks to attempt to improve call quality. However, WiFi calling can still cause issues on the device.

### Users with Dual SIM

Users with Dual SIM, especially when both SIM cards use the same network may face issues. Try switching your personal line off whilst making a call and see if the service improves.

### Airplane Mode

If you have WiFi calling enabled, try swiching your device into Airplane Mode to see if the call quality changes. Becuase the phone call travels over WiFi, this will help distinguish if the issue is with the cell tower nearest to your location or something else.

<Warning>
  When turning on Airplane Mode, you will not receive texts messages. After activating, it may take a moment for WiFi Calling to reappear. If WiFi Calling doesn't reappear, make sure it is turned on in Mobile Service.
</Warning>

### France & Switzerland

France & Switzerland are common destinations for call issues across a range of providers. For issues in France & Switzerland, we would reccomend using WhatsApp. Should you face constant issues within France and/or Switzerland, please report this via Mission Control.

### Still Having Issues?

Report the number via Candidate Whites on Mission Control and we will look into it. We will need 2 instances within 48 hours to raise with the network provider. When making the request, please make sure all information is provided accurately.

You can try using WhatsApp and FaceTime Audio to avoid the issue.
