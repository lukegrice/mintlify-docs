<Warning>
  If you are travelling outside of Europe, you must provide at least one weeks notice of your travel plans so we can enable data roaming with our supplier. This should be completed via a Support Ticket on Mission Control.
</Warning>

### Enable Data Roaming before you travel

1. In the Settings app, tap Mobile or Mobile Data. Then:
   - If your device has a single SIM card or eSIM, turn on Mobile Data, then tap Mobile Data Options.
   - If your device is running Dual SIM or Dual eSIM, turn on Mobile Data, tap the number you want to modify, then tap Mobile Data Options.
2. Turn on Data Roaming.

### I am travelling within Europe

<Warning>
  You do not need to open a support ticket if you are travelling within Europe. 
</Warning>

When travelling within Europe, you can use your device like you would within the UK. All UK data and UK minutes/texts work oversees as usual. You will need to enable data roaming before you travel via settings. 

<Check>
  Mobile Data will work as it would at home when travelling to the below countries considering you have Data Roaming enabled.

  By default, international dialling is disabled abroad. Should you need to use International Dialing, please submit a support ticket for an allowance approval before you travel.

### I am travelling outisde of Europe

<Info>
  Please submit a support ticket with the dates you'll be in each country. For example, "I will be travelling to India between 16th - 25th October".
</Info>

Where possible, we will try and accomodate all requests for roaming outside of the EU. Sometimes this requires approval from the Financial Director, so all requests must be submitted via a support ticket. 

In some cases, data roaming may be blocked (in destinations where costs are too high). Please open a support ticket for more information.
