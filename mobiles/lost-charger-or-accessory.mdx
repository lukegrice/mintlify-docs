### Mobile Phone Chargers

We provide everyone with either a USB-C to USB-C or Lightning to USB-C cable dependant on the type of device. We do not supply power blocks but you can charge your device using the mounted desk sockets (where applicable) or by plugging it into the laptop directly.

From time to time mobile phone chargers may become damaged due to wear and tear. If your charger stops working, you should open a support ticket to request a new one free of charge. You will need to return the old charger when receiving your new one.

Should you loose your mobile charger, please also open a support ticket and we will supply a new one. A charger of Â£20 applies for a replacement phone charger.

### Screen Protectors

<Warning>
  Do not remove the screen protector from your device. Should the screen become scratched or damaged as a result of not having a screen protector, you may be charged to replace the screen on the device.
</Warning>

We supply all devices with screen protectors to protect the device from damage. Should you crack your screen protector through accidental damage, please do not remove it. You can reach out via a support ticket and a new screen protector will be provided free of charge. 

In the rare case your device was supplied without a screen protector, it becomes your responsiblity to ask for one. You should reach out via a support ticket to request a new one and we will supply by the next working day.

### Phone cases

We provide a basic transparent case with all devices. Should you wish to purchase a more stylish case, you're welcome to do some considering that:

a) it does not modify the device (such as stickers and/or accessories)\
b) the case is rated to protect the device from drops and wear or tear.

If you need a new phone case to be supplied, please reach out via a support ticket and we will provide one free of charge.
